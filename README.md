# ECG
A ECG(electrocardiogram) machine, which is compact and budget friendly and useful for anyone having heart related issues or in general. 
It uses a AD8232 to get the data from the ECG sensor and then process it on a esp32 and then display it on a 2.8 inch TFT display, it has some optional buttons also to change functions or format.

## Why ECG machine
I have PSVT ( I am going to get the right treatment soon ) but I wanted to build something useful and practical and that could help someone. anyone can keep this in there home and use it at times of emergency or just normally.
