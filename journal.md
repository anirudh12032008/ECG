## June 30 - Created the main design and ideas
Spent a few hours researching about ECG and heart and pulse, I do have PSVT so I had a thought in mind to create a portable ecg machine, instead of going to hospital everytime. I'll soon have my treatment but there are many people who might get helped by this tool.
I tried to look up for what parts to include too.

## July 1 - Gathered all the components that I need to use and tried to make it as cheap as possible
completed my cart and added all necessary components I tried to find the best yet cheap versions. Took care of all the dimensions and tried to make it compact.

## July 2 - Completed the 3D case
Started working on the 3D, it was a bit fun after I have finished my first 3D model, so I knew what to do. Still some silly mistakes led me to spent more time that needed but I'm happy that I completed the full case in one go!!! It has spots for the tp4056 and esp32 and the AD8323 slot too, made place for fitting the back plate and added some fillet to make it look cool, the tricky part was related to the display getting fit in there. But then I just made it a complete cut
